## Frontend

The frontend is built using **React** and **Vite**, along with **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **Radix UI** for component primitives. It provides the user interface for the blogging site, handling the client-side rendering and user interactions.

### Features
- **Vite** for fast development and build tooling.
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with utilities.
- **React Router** for routing and navigation.
- **Axios** for HTTP requests.
- Various UI components from **Radix UI** and **Bootstrap**.

### Available Scripts
```bash
npm run dev       # Runs the development server
npm run build     # Builds the project for production
npm run lint      # Lints the code
npm run preview   # Previews the production build
```

### Dependencies
- React 18.3
- Tailwind CSS
- Radix UI components (Dialog, Dropdown, etc.)
- Axios
- React Icons
- React Router DOM
- Jodit React (for WYSIWYG editing)

---

## Common

This folder contains an **npm package** called `@100xdevs/common-app`, which provides shared utilities across the project. It uses **Zod** for schema validation.

### Key Features
- Custom reusable logic shared between the frontend and backend.
- **Zod** for type-safe schema validation.

### Package.json Overview
```json
{
  "name": "@100xdevs/common-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "zod": "^3.23.8"
  }
}
```

## Backend

The backend is a serverless API powered by **Hono** (a lightweight web framework for Cloudflare Workers) and **Prisma** (for database interactions). The backend handles user authentication, blog management, and integrates the common npm package for shared logic.

### Features
- **Hono** for routing and middleware.
- **Prisma** for database management with the help of **Prisma Client** and **Prisma Accelerate**.
- **JWT** for secure authentication.
- **Wrangler** for Cloudflare Workers deployment.

### Available Scripts
```bash
npm run dev       # Starts the backend in development mode
npm run deploy    # Deploys the backend using Wrangler to Cloudflare Workers
```

### Dependencies
- Hono 4.5.8
- Prisma 5.18.0
- Zod 3.23.8
- JWT for authentication
